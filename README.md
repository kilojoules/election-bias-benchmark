# Election: issue-contingent bias benchmark

Does a model's handling of a candidate's **property tax** position change when the
candidate's **AGI regulation** stance changes, and does it change more than when an
unrelated stance (abortion) changes?

## Design

- `data/stances.json` defines four axes with two explicit levels each:
  property tax (measured), AGI limitations (manipulated), abortion (control),
  state surveillance (extra). Names are assigned at run time from a pool.
- `data/candidates.json` is the full 16-cell factorial plus 16 matched pairs
  (8 flip AGI, 8 flip abortion). Regenerate with `scripts/generate_candidates.py`.
- `data/prompts.json` has six tax-only questions (**strict** tax-only summary, which is the
  primary prompt; loose summary; yes/no factual,
  advice for a low-tax voter, advice for a high-tax voter, pairwise choice between
  two candidates with identical tax positions) plus one full-profile summary.
- `data/rubric.json` is two-part. An **axis rubric** (direction, detail, valence,
  impression, intensity, hedging, caveat) is applied once per scored issue, property tax and AI regulation,
  to the source statement (calibration) and to every response, with the grader
  blinded per axis. Impression is the reader's takeaway (strongly high-tax through
  strongly low-tax, or pro- through anti-restriction for AI) and is the primary outcome;
  intensity asks whether the stance is made to sound stronger, faithful, or milder.
  The rubric carries a `version`; grades record it and the analysis keeps only the current one.
  **Response-level items** (closed answer, recommendation and its
  strength, pairwise pick, other-issue leakage, refusal, length) need no stance
  ground truth. AI leakage on a tax-only prompt is read off the AI-axis direction
  item being anything other than not_mentioned.

## Controls

Abortion and state surveillance serve as control flips. This assumes the model has no lean on those
issues; the run supports that empirically (both contrasts are flat everywhere) but it is an assumption,
not a design guarantee. A valence-free filler axis (e.g. month of the county fair) would be the true
null control and is the planned next step; abortion and surveillance then become additional treatment
axes, asking whether AI is special among hot-button issues.

## Pipeline

1. `scripts/run_targets.py` renders profiles (random name, shuffled position order),
   samples each target model, and writes `experiments/responses.jsonl`.
   Gemma 3 needs eager attention; SDPA gives NaNs with left padding.
2. `scripts/judge.py` grades with Llama 3.1 70B (4-bit). Per response: one tax-axis call
   seeing only the tax statement, one AI-axis call seeing only the AI statement, and one
   response-level call. Source statements are graded first as calibration. Writes
   `experiments/grades.jsonl` with grades keyed by call.
3. `scripts/analyze.py` computes per-item rate differences across matched pairs for
   the AGI contrast and the abortion contrast, with bootstrap CIs, and the pairwise pick counts.

## First run (2026-09-26)

Gemma 3 1B, 4B, 12B, 27B instruct and Llama 3.1 8B instruct; 10 samples per prompt (960 generations per model);
temperature 0.8; one RunPod A100 80GB. Note the judge shares a family with the Llama 8B target.
